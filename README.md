Step-by-Step Guide:
Import Libraries: You'll need dash, pandas, and plotly.express for the dashboard and visualization.
Prepare Data: Use sample crime data in a pandas DataFrame.
Create Layout: Use Dash components like dropdowns, graphs, and HTML elements to build the layout.
Add Interactivity: Set up callbacks to make the dashboard interactive.
Breakdown of the Code:
Data Setup:

A sample dataset is created in the data dictionary. Replace it with your actual dataset (e.g., from a CSV file or a database).
The dataset contains columns like 'Region', 'Year', 'Crime Type', and 'Crime Rate (per 100,000)'.
Plotly Bar Chart:

We create an initial bar chart showing crime rates by region and crime type using plotly.express.
Dashboard Layout:

html.Div: A container for the entire dashboard.
dcc.Dropdown: A dropdown that allows users to select a region.
dcc.Graph: Displays the bar chart and the line chart.
Callbacks:

Bar Chart Callback: Updates the bar chart based on the selected region from the dropdown.
Line Chart Callback: Updates a line chart showing crime trends over time for the selected region.
Running the Server:

The app.run_server(debug=True) command starts the Dash app locally, where you can interact with the dashboard in your browser.
Features of the Dashboard:
Dropdown: Allows users to select a region for analysis.
Bar Chart: Displays crime rates by type for the selected region.
Line Chart: Displays the trend of crime rates over the years for the selected region.
Replace the sample dataset with actual crime data, potentially including more regions, crime types, and time frames.
Customize the visuals by adding additional plots like pie charts, heatmaps, or choropleth maps.
